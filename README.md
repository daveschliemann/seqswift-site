## About the Founder

SeqSwift is built by **Dave Schliemann, MD** — a fourth-year international medical graduate completing clinical training in the United States.

During a recent family-medicine clerkship, the young daughter of his preceptor — a little girl he and the team cared for together in clinic — died of an overwhelming infection that rapid diagnostics might have caught sooner. At the same time, several close friends and former colleagues from Kenya lost patients and family members to late-diagnosed sepsis and resistant pathogens.

Those two losses made the mission personal: *no child, anywhere, should die because a genomic result took days instead of seconds.*

Self-taught in systems programming (MIT 6.001 via MITx), with prior contributions to the *Journal of Visualized Experiments (JoVE)* and technology analysis at Forrester Research in Cambridge, he moved to Atlanta in 2024 to build SeqSwift — sub-second, bedside-ready sequencing that runs on a $499 edge device, in a Level-I trauma bay or a rural Kenyan ward.

> **No big lab. No big budget.**  
> **Just code that refuses to let the next child wait.**
